# Developer Guidelines

* Please follow all guidelines posted here:

  * [Coding Standards](http://labs.wsu.edu/forbes/public/student_resources/prerequisites/#Coding)

  For example:
  
  * Please make sure your code passes Flake8 tests.  You can check by
    running something like:
  
    ```bash
    flake8 mmf_hfb/integrate.py
    ```

    If you need to ignore a check, please explicitly add this to
    `setup.cfg` with an explanation.

   * Provide tests for your code.  Aim to get as close to 100% code
     coverage as possible.

  * Please commit your code with messages that conform to the
    instructions posted on the following page:
  

### What is this repository for? ###

I probably will put other things such as some testing code, some write-up for the future thesis here.
