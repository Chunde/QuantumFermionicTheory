BLD,ENH,TST: Added tf_correction code, tests, and config files.

.hgignore:
- Added.  Ignore some cache directories, coverage output etc.

quantum_turbulence/ASLDA.py:
- Move this to the _trash directory... until this code has a change of
  passing tests, it should not be included in the main directory.

pytest.ini:
- This provides configuration options for py.test.  In particular, it
  triggers coverage testing.

setup.cfg:
- Some other configuration options for linting, etc.

quantum_turbulence/tf_completion.py:
quantum_turbulence/test_tf_completion.py:
- Main code for integrals...  Will use numba for performance (see the
  next DOC update.)
